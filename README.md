This is a modular voice assistant. Updates Soon!

If you wanna create your own module I made two modules that create basic or custom modules a basic module just runs a function named run and custom modules will execute other function names

To use The Hey John Module you will need a Open AI API Key and it will cost money unless you still have the free trial.
